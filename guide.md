**like Nethack, but with guns**

This is a quick start guide.

Your goal is to kill as many bad guys as you can.

It is a coffeebreak roguelike, so don't expect to find complex in depth gameplay.

Gameplay tips
=============

If you have played roguelikes before, this game should not be hard to learn. Keyboard layout is similiar to Nethack.

This game focuses more on the ranged combat, on close combat you are usually losing, so try to keep distance.

When you start the game you should (w)ield your gun, (r)reload it and then (f)ire it at a direction.

If you cannot find the stairs down (>) you should try to clear the floor with dynamite or other explosives.
